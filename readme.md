# The Timber Starter Theme (M Agency Edition)

The "\_s" for Timber: a dead-simple theme that you can build from. The primary purpose of this theme is to provide a file structure rather than a framework for markup or styles. Configure your SASS files, scripts, and task runners however you would like!

## What We've Tweaked

- Added TailwindCSS and Alpine.js for UI/UX development.
- Added ACF Blocks for custom block development.
- Added build scripts.
  - Install: `npm install`
  - Development script: `npm run dev`
  - Build script: `npm run build`
